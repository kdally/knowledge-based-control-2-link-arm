3.3/ controller_1 determines the model parameters based on the current state, while controller_2 uses the desired state. They correspond to an Open-Loop Feedforward and Feedback control law.

Without feedback and the initial conditions not at the desired location, it is seen that the error starts at a large non-zero value, and grows over time. This is because there is no feedback to get rid of the error, but a pure fee-forward control mechanism.

When setting the initia conditions to the desired location, the initial error is zero, yet  also grows over time due to the lack of feedback.
